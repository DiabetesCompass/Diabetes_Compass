# Purpose
BG Compass provides an evolving tool for use by type 1 diabetics to visualize the effects of the choices made daily in managing their disease.The goal is to make the plots of estimated BG, trends, and estimated HA1c as accurate as is possible using the information that is typically used for this. The two major contributors to the curves of estimated blood glucose (BG) are, of course, food and insulin. This app provides a simple means of accessing food nutritional content (carbohydrate) data by extracting that data from internet databases or from historical data input by the user. The user is able to select the type of fast acting insulin they use to compensate for food or drink consumed and the app plots a typical estimated BG dose response for the dose selected using the patients own insulin sensitivity adjusted for the timing of that dose. Likewise, the app computes a typical dose response curve from the food that is selected or input by the user, including the timing of that food, and combines that dose with the insulin dose response. Thus, the app computes a composite curve that includes all those variables and their timing. This response is first displayed as a tentative curve allowing the user to make adjustments in the timing or dosing of any variable and visualizing how those changes might effect the overall curve. This, therefore allows a user to modify and adjust management and planning as seen fit to optimize results. Measured BG data is also input to the app to make further adjustments as time goes by. This allows the user to choose adjustment doses more carefully and efficiently rather than just guessing. The app also includes code for estimating hemoglobin A1c (HA1c) to further help users tune their diet and insulin dosing by visualizing trend curves of estimated HA1c on a daily basis.
